# Java
Here are a few projects that I have worked in my bootcamp for Java these projects were focused on utilzing Spring Boot with Eclipse as the IDE. 
These are modularized projects, MAVEN build tool, and WAR files through Spring Initializr, adhereing to the MVC architecture, with built out http api method calls and linked to MySQL db.
